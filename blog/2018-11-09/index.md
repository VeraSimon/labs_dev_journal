## thing

As a part of your journal entry, write ¼ to ½ a page reflecting on your experiences forming a team. What did you do to help the team solidify as a group? What did you do that you now realize caused friction in this process?

As a group, provide links to evidence that:

Front end is deployed with a recognizable name. The site can be visited and will load a simple message
Back end is deployed with a recognizable name. The address can be visited and will return data
User accounts are created: Either through a tool, or the front end, a user account can be created and signed in.
